At this time I must call on the president of this GITHUB outfit to complain about being here for nearly an hour and still not GITTING my NEW and FREE HUBCAPS?

I sure hope that I am not stepping on any toes in doing this but my darling Olds without her front teeth is lookin' mighty sad!!!

In the name of heaven, I implore you to call yer best dentist to GIT her some new teeth... errr...  HUBCAPS...

Sincere plea from a very concerned retired gentleman for his Bessie!
