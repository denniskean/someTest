Learning GitHub
Okay, about me...  I am too old to remember anything.  In fact I do not even remember why I came here.  
Somehow I was looking for something about getting Hubcaps for my Old Oldsmobile and I ended up here on gitHub.  
So, I started following the directions hoping that I could Git some free Hubcaps for my Olds.

I certainly hope that this effort will result in me receiving free hubcaps, or I will call someone in charge to git this scam off the Internet.  I may not know what the Internet is, but I know that this would be illegal if I were not to Git my Hub-caps (on GitHub) .  Comprende???
